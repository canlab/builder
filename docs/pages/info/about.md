This tool intends to make it easier for researchers (and those that might not have
experienced with using continuous integration, or building containers) to build, test,
and deploy a reproducible experiments container. 


## The Experiment Factory

The scientific filesystem provides the base for building and deployment of these experiment containers!  Read more about it (and find corresponding publications) at <a href="https://expfactory.github.io" target="_blank">expfactory.github.io</a> or post an issue on any board on our
