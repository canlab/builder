This tool intends to make it easier for researchers (and those that might not have
experienced with using continuous integration, or building containers) to build, test,
and deploy a reproducible container.

The scientific filesystem provides internal modularity for containers, allowing
for a single reproducible container to have multiple entrypoints that can easily be
inspected, tested, and run. Read more about it in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/5/giy023/4931737" target="_blank">Gigascience</a> or the
